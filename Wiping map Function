//0 means empty
//1 means that theres something there 

void clear_map(int map[][100], int size) { //map is our array and size is how big our function is 
    for (int x = 0; x < size; x++) { //the for loop goes through every column 
        for (int y = 0; y < size; y++) { //this for loop goes through every row 
            map[x][y] = 0; //from here, every x and y value gets a value of 0, therefore, resetting the whole thing

//clear_map(costmap, MAP_SIZE);
 we will call this in int main
